We can choose to apply more or less cognitive effort depending on the task at hand.Now, Claude has that same flexibility. With the new Claude 3.7 Sonnet, users can toggle \u201cextended thinking mode\u201d on or off, directing the model to think more deeply about trickier questions1. And developers can even set a \u201cthinking budget\u201d to control precisely how long Claude spends on a problem.Extended thinking mode isn\u2019t an option that switches to a different model with a separate strategy. Instead, it\u2019s allowing the very same model to give itself more time, and expend more effort, in coming to an answer.Claude's new extended thinking capability gives it an impressive boost in intelligence. But it also raises many important questions for those interested in how AI models work, how to evaluate them, and how to improve their safety. In this post, we share some of the insights we've gained.The visible thought processAs well as giving Claude the ability to think for longer and thus answer tougher questions, we\u2019ve decided to make its thought process visible in raw form. This has several benefits:Trust. Being able to observe the way Claude thinks makes it easier to understand and check its answers\u2014and might help users get better outputs.Alignment. In some of our previous Alignment Science research, we\u2019ve used contradictions between what the model inwardly thinks and what it outwardly says to identify when it might be engaging in concerning behaviors like deception.Interest. It\u2019s often fascinating to watch Claude think. Some of our researchers with math and physics backgrounds have noted how eerily similar Claude\u2019s thought process is to their own way of reasoning through difficul"
