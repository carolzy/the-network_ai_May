# ​Build That Thing in Your Head —Tonight

![User Uploaded Image](https://images.lumacdn.com/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=cover,dpr=2,quality=75,width=800,height=600/editor-images/5m/28badc80-9aa9-40be-b2ad-21c587cd2190.jpg)

​ **Pizza. Beers. And watching your product ideas come to life in real-time. No engineers required.**

​We've all been there: that brilliant product idea you can't stop thinking about, stuck in Figma purgatory while engineering is sprinting on something else. What if you could just... build it?

![User Uploaded Image](https://images.lumacdn.com/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=cover,dpr=2,quality=75,width=4032/editor-images/3g/8c3566e3-e557-480c-9eba-424b2752a68e.jpg)

## ​This isn't another ""learn to code"" meetup.

​The Emergent team is hosting a small, invite-only hangout in SF for enthusiastic Product Designers, where you'll witness something kind of magical: Designers like you describing products in plain English and watching them materialize into working, full-stack applications. Not mockups. Not prototypes. Real, shippable products.

​

## ​Very limited spots. One unforgettable evening.

​We're keeping this intimate. Come vibe with fellow product leaders over craft beers and great pizza while we show you how ""vibecoding"" is quietly transforming how the most innovative teams are shipping products. Describe your product challenge, and watch as it becomes reality right before your eyes.

## ​The good stuff:

- ​See it to believe it: Live demos of Designers building functioning products using just conversation

- ​Hands-on time: Describe YOUR idea and watch the magic unfold

- ​Real talk: How this changes everything about your product roadmap and delivery timeline

- ​Your people: Connect with forward-thinking Designers who are as excited about this trend as you are

- ​Did we mention pizza and beer?

# ​Build That Thing in Your Head —Tonight

![User Uploaded Image](https://images.lumacdn.com/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=cover,dpr=2,quality=75,width=800,height=600/editor-images/5m/28badc80-9aa9-40be-b2ad-21c587cd2190.jpg)

​ **Pizza. Beers. And watching your product ideas come to life in real-time. No engineers required.**

​We've all been there: that brilliant product idea you can't stop thinking about, stuck in Figma purgatory while engineering is sprinting on something else. What if you could just... build it?

## ​This isn't another ""learn to code"" meetup.

​The Emergent team is hosting a small, invite-only hangout in SF for enthusiastic Product Designers, where you'll witness something kind of magical: Designers like you describing products in plain English and watching them materialize into working, full-stack applications. Not mockups. Not prototypes. Real, shippable products.

​

## ​Very limited spots. One unforgettable evening.

​We're keeping this intimate. Come vibe with fellow product leaders over craft beers and great pizza while we show you how ""vibecoding"" is quietly transforming how the most innovative teams are shipping products. Describe your product challenge, and watch as it becomes reality right before your eyes.

## ​The good stuff:

- ​See it to believe it: Live demos of Designers building functioning products using just conversation

- ​Hands-on time: Describe YOUR idea and watch the magic unfold

- ​Real talk: How this changes everything about your product roadmap and delivery timeline

- ​Your people: Connect with forward-thinking Designers who are as excited about this trend as you are

- ​Did we mention pizza and beer?

About Event

​Note: while there are many guests listed in the RSVP, most of these are carried over from previous events in this series. We don't expect much more than 30 to attend.

I'm interested in having some laid-back yet stimulating conversations about some of my favorite pieces of short fiction.

​A general aim of the stories will be to explore alternative possible worlds through fiction with the hope of gaining more insight into our own. To that end, many of the short stories will include an element of futurism, speculation, and social commentary. We’ll feature authors like Ted Chiang, Ursula K Le Guin, Greg Egan, and others.

About Event

​🌍 **What if the key to fighting climate change starts with stopping cows from burping methane?**

​Join us at The Wave as we host **Alex Brown**, cofounder and CEO of **Alga Biosciences**, a startup tackling a major contributor to climate change: methane emissions from cows. By preventing this potent greenhouse gas at the source, Alga is rethinking what climate solutions can look like.

​In this talk, we’ll explore the bigger picture:

– What’s the right _order of operations_ for tackling the climate crisis?

– Can we _depoliticize_ climate change?

– What role should _capitalism_ play in solving it?

– And how do we balance _evolution_ vs. _revolution_ in industry?

​The answers may not be clear-cut, but this conversation will spark new ideas, challenge old assumptions, and leave us all with a little more hope about the future. 🌱

## ​​About Our Ticket Structure

​We’re not taking a profit—every ticket sold goes directly back into the business. Our pricing also depends on the venue, and this space charges us a rental fee, which is why tickets for this event are slightly higher than previous ones.

​That said, we’re committed to making our events accessible to everyone. If cost is a barrier, please don’t hesitate to reach out by emailing us at **bigbrainsanfrancisco@gmail.com**—we reserve a handful of tickets for financial assistance at every event.

​Thanks for supporting our growing mission!

​​ **_\*For any other questions or special accommodations, please email bigbrainsanfrancisco@gmail.com._**

​It'll be 15 years to the day since Bitcoin was first used to buy a real-world asset. On May 22, 2010, Laszlo Hanyecz bought two pizzas for 10,000 BTC. Today, that's over $1B Dollars (up $400M from last year). That's a pretty big f'ing deal!

About Event

# ​ **Immortality or Death**

​ _A Manifesto-Exhibition and Launch of the Eponymous Book_

​

## ​ **Why This Matters**

​For centuries, humanity has stormed the citadel of aging, only to discover that each scientific conquest reveals yet another rampart. The farther we press into the biology of senescence, the more labyrinthine the problem becomes—so vast that the very coordinates of “life,” “time,” and “consciousness” seem irretrievable, up for renegotiation, possibly undiscoverable.

​Despite the repeated failed assaults of empirical methods, the will to live—our most instinctual and inextinguishable ""flame""—vaults past the barricades. Indeed, it is in the province of art that we witness this flame burn.

​In Immortality or Death, we see six artists wield that flame, showing us the stakes are high as they explore what might lie beyond the barricades.

​

## ​ **Your Experience**

​Seven radical vitalists— **Misha Batin, Dominique Darvas, Nastya Egorova, Mark Hamalainen, Yan Granat, Olga Posukh, and Liza Povysheva**—tear open the familiar Longevity playbook and scatter its pages to the wind. Their canvases and installations prod five questions that refuse polite silence:

​ 1\. _Whose life are we trying to prolong—and what, exactly, is a “person”?_

​ 2\. _What lies beneath life’s habitual patterns?_

​ 3\. _If a life-affirming force propels us, what equal and opposite force impedes us?_

​ 4\. _Under what circumstances might our courage coalesce into a collective assault on mortality?_

​ 5\. _In which domains should we labor if we truly mean to invent an anti-aging cure?_

​Each work is a visual gauntlet, an intellectual slap, a dare to converse without euphemism.

​

## ​ **The Book Premiere**

​Opening night features science-writer-provocateur **Alexander Panchin**, unveiling _[Immortality or Death](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F93JBB1D)_—a field guide to the biology of aging where rigor collides, headlong, with audacious futures.

​

## ​ **Why Come**

​This is not merely an art event; it is a **laboratory of the spirit**.

​ • The artworks function as experimental rigs for your convictions.

​ • The book doubles as a manual for translating the aesthetics of immortality into concrete strategy.

​ • You, the visitor, become a co-author of an unfolding future—one that must either defeat death or capitulate to it, irrevocably.

​If your appetite for life refuses the comforts of actuarial tables—if yesterday’s answers feel threadbare—join us **May 22 at 17:00**. Witness how art sharpens itself into a new instrument for species-level self-preservation.

​Because **Immortality or Death** is not a rhetorical flourish. It is the decision history now places in our hands.

​ _We will have two tours on May 22nd: at 5pm and at 7pm._

​ _Admission: $20_

​ _Dress-code: elevated / futuristic_

​ _Immortality drinks, snacks and guided discussions are provided._

About Event

# ​ **Immortality or Death**

​ _A Manifesto-Exhibition and Launch of the Eponymous Book_

​

## ​ **Why This Matters**

​For centuries, humanity has stormed the citadel of aging, only to discover that each scientific conquest reveals yet another rampart. The farther we press into the biology of senescence, the more labyrinthine the problem becomes—so vast that the very coordinates of “life,” “time,” and “consciousness” seem irretrievable, up for renegotiation, possibly undiscoverable.

​Despite the repeated failed assaults of empirical methods, the will to live—our most instinctual and inextinguishable ""flame""—vaults past the barricades. Indeed, it is in the province of art that we witness this flame burn.

​In Immortality or Death, we see six artists wield that flame, showing us the stakes are high as they explore what might lie beyond the barricades.

​

## ​ **Your Experience**

​Seven radical vitalists— **Misha Batin, Dominique Darvas, Nastya Egorova, Mark Hamalainen, Yan Granat, Olga Posukh, and Liza Povysheva**—tear open the familiar Longevity playbook and scatter its pages to the wind. Their canvases and installations prod five questions that refuse polite silence:

​ 1\. _Whose life are we trying to prolong—and what, exactly, is a “person”?_

​ 2\. _What lies beneath life’s habitual patterns?_

​ 3\. _If a life-affirming force propels us, what equal and opposite force impedes us?_

​ 4\. _Under what circumstances might our courage coalesce into a collective assault on mortality?_

​ 5\. _In which domains should we labor if we truly mean to invent an anti-aging cure?_

​Each work is a visual gauntlet, an intellectual slap, a dare to converse without euphemism.

​

## ​ **The Book Premiere**

​Opening night features science-writer-provocateur **Alexander Panchin**, unveiling _[Immortality or Death](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F93JBB1D)_—a field guide to the biology of aging where rigor collides, headlong, with audacious futures.

​

## ​ **Why Come**

​This is not merely an art event; it is a **laboratory of the spirit**.

​ • The artworks function as experimental rigs for your convictions.

​ • The book doubles as a manual for translating the aesthetics of immortality into concrete strategy.

​ • You, the visitor, become a co-author of an unfolding future—one that must either defeat death or capitulate to it, irrevocably.

​If your appetite for life refuses the comforts of actuarial tables—if yesterday’s answers feel threadbare—join us **May 22 at 17:00**. Witness how art sharpens itself into a new instrument for species-level self-preservation.

​Because **Immortality or Death** is not a rhetorical flourish. It is the decision history now places in our hands.

​ _We will have two tours on May 22nd: at 5pm and at 7pm._

​ _Admission: $20_

​ _Dress-code: elevated / futuristic_

​ _Immortality drinks, snacks and guided discussions are provided._

About Event

​Hey, Bay Area builders and tinkerers!

This time we are hosted by Cisco Meraki and sponsored by Gusto! We are quickly crafting the agenda now, and it's going to be amazing thanks to all of you.

🎙️ Submit a talk proposal here:​ [https://forms.gle/C9HQzaT5jvwA5xwc7](https://forms.gle/C9HQzaT5jvwA5xwc7)

​Ruby is the quiet force behind the Bay Area's most successful tech organizations and startups from GitHub, Shopify and Stripe to Figma, Chime, and [bolt.new](https://bolt.new/).

​We are gathering every month to learn, share, inspire each other, and it feels great because of MINASWAN 💗.

​Our meetups explore building and scaling Ruby and Rails applications. We go deep into technical topics and don't shy away from new ideas and weird experiments! We always have an open mic for everyone's announcements or questions🎙️! Join us in discovering the nicest Ruby HQs 🏙️❤️

Catch you on the flip side! A massive shoutout to **Cisco Meraki** for hosting!

Previously, he was involved in clinical development, fundraising, and ultimately securing regulatory clearance and national insurance reimbursement for an AI-powered medical device at a Japanese med-tech startup. He then moved to the United States to found Universal Brain in 2022, tackling a fundamental gap in psychiatry: the routine measurement of brain function.Universal Brain’s platform captures well-validated brain function measures, called event-related potentials (ERPs), that reflect core neural processes linked to depression and its treatment.

​Kazu Okuda, M.D. is a physician turned neuro‑technology entrepreneur driven to improve mental health care. Previously, he was involved in clinical development, fundraising, and ultimately securing regulatory clearance and national insurance reimbursement for an AI-powered medical device at a Japanese med-tech startup. He then moved to the United States to found Universal Brain in 2022, tackling a fundamental gap in psychiatry: the routine measurement of brain function.Universal Brain’s platform captures well-validated brain function measures, called event-related potentials (ERPs), that reflect core neural processes linked to depression and its treatment. By turning these EEG‑based measures into a scalable, clinic‑ready tool, he aims to make objective brain‑function testing a standard component of mental‑health care to get better outcomes—starting with depression and expanding across psychiatric conditions.

​Over the course of the day, we will cover topics including the MCP roadmap, security and identity, MCP orchestration and management, observability, MCP registries, as well as how developers are adopting the protocol and building it into their applications.

​​Join us in San Francisco on May 23. Unfortunately, capacity is limited to 300 people. Registration fee is $275 - click below to snag a spot.

​We'd like to thank our sponsors Amazon Web Services and Cisco, whose generous support has made the event possible.

About Event

​Note: while there are many guests listed in the RSVP, most of these are carried over from previous events in this series. We don't expect much more than 30 to attend.

""Imagination without reason is mere fancy, but reason without imagination is sterile. That is partly why scientists and philosophers alike have always used imaginary scenarios to help sharpen their ideas and push them to their limits."" - _The Pig that Wants to be Eaten_, by Julian Baggini

For this meeting (May 21), we'll be discussing skepticism and whether we can know if we are brains in a vat, living in a simulation, being deceived by an all-powerful demon, etc.

- ​We'll take some time at the meeting to read about GE Moore's argument against skepticism: [https://www.lse.ac.uk/philosophy/blog/2020/09/29/g-e-moores-hands-vs-radical-scepticism/](https://www.lse.ac.uk/philosophy/blog/2020/09/29/g-e-moores-hands-vs-radical-scepticism/)

- ​And also this primer on philosophical discourse: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Gj3HesfWz4A2kEAMSY0x7hNxvJZNtiCexUeilJXVak8/edit?tab=t.0](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Gj3HesfWz4A2kEAMSY0x7hNxvJZNtiCexUeilJXVak8/edit?tab=t.0)

- ​It is highly recommended to also read this short article beforehand: [https://spot.colorado.edu/~huemer/V.htm](https://spot.colorado.edu/~huemer/V.htm)


​Some examples of things we've discussed at past meetings:

- ​Could a vegetarian eat a pig with a clear conscience, if that pig wanted to be eaten?

- ​Does a person survive using a teleporter that destroys the body and recreates it with perfect fidelity?

- ​Does the existence of evil in the world pose a problem for belief in a benevolent God?


​We'll be meeting in the 550 Room (down the stairs on the North side). Contact me by text if you're having trouble finding the location.

​On the Wednesdays when we're not running this event, we'll often be having similar discussions here: [https://lu.ma/shortstories](https://lu.ma/shortstories)

About Event

​ **[Hosted by HRC Fertility](https://www.havingbabies.com/locations/san-francisco/)**

​As conversations about fertility, AI, and education move from the clinic to Congress—and from the coasts into cultural mainstream—a new generation is asking: W _hat kind of future are we building, and for whom?_

​This panel brings together leaders from healthcare, tech, and education to explore how innovation is reshaping the landscape for parenthood.

​🎙 Featuring:

​ [Kay Waud](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kay-waud-85483b59/), MD, PhD, HRC Fertility Reproductive endocrinologist at HRC Fertility with an engineering background, focused on expanding access and education on fertility care

​ [Christina Ren](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christinaren1/), MS, CGC Genetic counselor specializing in translating complex genomic data and leading initiatives to make PGT testing more accessible

​ [Jasmine Su](https://x.com/jasminewsun) [n](https://jasmi.news/) is a writer and technologist exploring the cultural and political impact of disruptive technologies in the age of AGI and Silicon Valley

[Saachi Dhingra](https://www.linkedin.com/in/saachidhingra/) is the founder of [Sachi](https://gosachi.com/), a VC-backed startup connecting families with licensed PreK–12 educators for flexible, specialized childcare and learning. She’s spent over a decade bridging gaps between families and early education systems.

Moderated by [Livia Han](https://www.linkedin.com/in/livia-han-842802137/), a women's health advocate

## ​ **Discussion Topics Will Include**

- ​Breakthroughs in fertility care, including AI-guided diagnostics and next-gen embryo selection tools

- ​How access to technologies like PGT is shaped by systemic inequities and what it will take to expand access

- ​What it means to treat parenthood as civic infrastructure, and how that shifts our approach to healthcare, education, and tech

- ​Building trusted, flexible childcare solutions for modern families and what it means to redesign early education from the ground up


​Whether you’re a future parent, a policymaker, an investor, or someone questioning how AI fits into the story of your life—this is the conversation for you.

About Event

​ **[Hosted by HRC Fertility](https://www.havingbabies.com/locations/san-francisco/)**

​As conversations about fertility, AI, and education move from the clinic to Congress—and from the coasts into cultural mainstream—a new generation is asking: W _hat kind of future are we building, and for whom?_

​This panel brings together leaders from healthcare, tech, and education to explore how innovation is reshaping the landscape for parenthood.

​🎙 Featuring:

​ [Kay Waud](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kay-waud-85483b59/), MD, PhD, HRC Fertility Reproductive endocrinologist at HRC Fertility with an engineering background, focused on expanding access and education on fertility care

​ [Christina Ren](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christinaren1/), MS, CGC Genetic counselor specializing in translating complex genomic data and leading initiatives to make PGT testing more accessible

​ [Jasmine Su](https://x.com/jasminewsun) [n](https://jasmi.news/) is a writer and technologist exploring the cultural and political impact of disruptive technologies in the age of AGI and Silicon Valley

[Saachi Dhingra](https://www.linkedin.com/in/saachidhingra/) is the founder of [Sachi](https://gosachi.com/), a VC-backed startup connecting families with licensed PreK–12 educators for flexible, specialized childcare and learning. She’s spent over a decade bridging gaps between families and early education systems.

Moderated by [Livia Han](https://www.linkedin.com/in/livia-han-842802137/), a women's health advocate

* * *

## ​ **Discussion Topics Will Include**

- ​Breakthroughs in fertility care, including AI-guided diagnostics and next-gen embryo selection tools

- ​How access to technologies like PGT is shaped by systemic inequities and what it will take to expand access

- ​What it means to treat parenthood as civic infrastructure, and how that shifts our approach to healthcare, education, and tech

- ​Building trusted, flexible childcare solutions for modern families and what it means to redesign early education from the ground up


​Whether you’re a future parent, a policymaker, an investor, or someone questioning how AI fits into the story of your life—this is the conversation for you.

About Event

​ _Connecting powerful women who’ve outgrown surface-level spaces._

​ **A space that recognizes that “Too Much” isn’t a Liability. It’s Your Leverage.**

​Normal is canceled.

​People pleasing never built an empire.

​At Too Much Brunch, your loud, brilliant, ambitious self is the **entry ticket**—not something to tone down.

​This is a room for women who are ready for a mojo-activating experience —and are ready to channel it into aligned leadership, elevated visibility, and real relationships.

# ​ **What You’ll Walk Away With:**

​This isn’t just breakfast and chit-chat. You’ll leave with:

- ​ **Curated matchmaking**: No random convos—get paired with aligned women based on your goals and interests.

- ​ **Powerhouse networking** with founders, execs, creatives, and thought leaders

- ​A **signature “Too Much” activation workshop** with Sara Anderson

- ​ **Professional photos** that capture your power in the room

- ​ **A network you want to follow up with**, not just a list of LinkedIns

- ​The momentum, clarity, and _audacity_ to make your next big move

​So you’ve closed your first customers yourself, maybe hired a couple of folks to help — and then you need to turn that into a scalable sales machine.

​ **How to scale results, not sales mess?** For this, Awesomic is bringing the top practitioners to you to answer off the record the most burning questions:

- ​How to know when you’re ready to scale?

- ​What are the most expensive mistakes, and how to not make them?

- ​How to generate more sales without increasing costs and complexity?

- ​How to structure the team right?

- ​... your own question?


​Our host is **Mike Weber,** VP of Sales at Awesomic — known as sales powerhouse from companies like Quancast, Intercom and Carta. He has led Quancast from $0 to $400M in revenue and helped Intercom to grow outbound sales from 2% to 40% of revenue. Mike knows it all: from early stage fires to being a key sales contributor at Series D stage.

​His speaker for fireside chat is **Chris Martellotti**, a seasoned seller and founder with 2 decades of experience of building revenue, teams and companies. His career includes building Enterprise Sales department at Dolby, business development leadership at Quancast and AdBrite, and successfully launching own AI-powered startup The Lyceum.

## ​ **Talks**

​ **Talk 1:** How do we create the “ChatGPT moment” for 3D understanding?

**Speaker**: Zach Sussman (Co-Founder & CTO @ Mach9)

**Abstract**: Twenty years ago, understanding and extracting meaning from unstructured text was an open research question; now it’s solvable with an API call to a large language model.

​ **Talk 2:** Transforming the safety industry using computer vision

**Speaker**: Abhishek Venkataraman (Director of Perception @ Voxel) & Brandon Loyd (VP of Product @ Voxel)

**Abstract**: Voxel’s computer‑vision platform transforms existing camera networks into a real‑time safety intelligence layer, flagging hazards before they escalate and dramatically reducing incident rates across warehouses, retail distribution centers, and manufacturing plants.

## ​About [Springcamp](https://www.springcamp.co/):

​We believe that the core of early-stage investing is being the first to find extraordinary founders and then to relentlessly support them in their pursuit of big dreams.

​With this vision, we are proud to have shared the journey with many startups in our portfolio who have become leaders in their respective industries. When we believe and invest in a startup, we become not just their investor, but we see our role often take shape as a friend, sometimes as a family, or even at times simply as a fan.

​We aim to be a reliable partner by creating an ecosystem that enables our startups to spring up and flourish together.

## ​About [Tech + Startups Community](https://www.techandstartups.com/):

​​​​Launched in 2023, we are a community of 10,000+ Startup Founders, Investors and Tech Leaders. We are active in Silicon Valley, New York, Miami, Boston, Atlanta, London, Santa Monica, Dubai, Bogota, Washington DC, Orlando, Boston, Chicago, Atlanta, Raleigh, and beyond.
