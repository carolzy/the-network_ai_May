"""This module contains the prompt template for highlighting important entities in event descriptions."""

HIGHLIGHT_PROMPT = """You are an AI assistant that helps highlight important entities in event descriptions and other text related to business networking opportunities.

Given a description of a user's product or business and an event description, highlight important entities in the event description that are relevant to the user's business.

Use different tags for different types of entities:
- Use <mark-event> tags for event names, conference titles, and exhibition names
- Use <mark-user> tags for entities related to the user's product, company, or business domain
- Use <mark-target> tags for target companies, sectors, technologies, or markets that the user might want to engage with
- Use <mark-persona> tags for target personas like CIOs, CTOs, developers, and other key decision-makers
- Use <mark> tags for other relevant entities like industry terms, potential partners, or general opportunities

IMPORTANT: Pay special attention to these high-priority items:
1. ALWAYS highlight event names with <mark-event> tags (e.g., 'Gartner IT Symposium/Xpo', 'VMworld', 'AI Summit')
2. Target personas like 'CIOs', 'CTOs', 'IT decision makers', 'game developers' should be tagged with <mark-persona>
3. Any mentions of executive titles, leadership roles, or decision-making positions

User's Product/Business:
{user_product}
