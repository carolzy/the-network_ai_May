About Event

‚ÄãIf you're in town for WWDC25, you're welcome at CommunityKit ‚Äì we'll be hosting WWDC25 keynote & SOTU watch party, meetups, workshops, hackathons, and more, so that everyone can come and meet like-minded developers in the heart of Cupertino.

You can check out our site for the schedule: [https://communitykit.social/schedule.html](https://communitykit.social/schedule.html)

# ‚ÄãOur Goal

‚ÄãGet ready to make the most of your WWDC experience with CommunityKit, located at the intersection of innovation and celebration. From June 9 though 11, join us at the Hyatt House Cupertino to gather with your fellow participants, learn so many new things, and build some great memories.

‚ÄãEach day, we‚Äôll be joined by our wonderful communities, such as Shortcuts, and iOSDevHappyHour, to name a few. We'll also be hosting a live recording of Swift over Coffee, focusing on everything new at WWDC.

‚ÄãThe collaboration within the indie dev community is a prime example of how we build one another up, especially since we often have to be both developers and designers. We're thrilled to share that we're hosting slots for indies of all backgrounds to show off their current project. It could be an app, design, or anything in between.

‚ÄãAs you can see, we‚Äôve got a lot of fun and great experience planned this year, and we can‚Äôt wait for June to get here so we can all get together and put the Community in CommunityKit.

‚Äã

‚ÄãWe are proudly sponsored by RevenueCat

About Event

‚ÄãNote: while there are many guests listed in the RSVP, most of these are carried over from previous events in this series. We don't expect much more than 30 to attend.

""Imagination without reason is mere fancy, but reason without imagination is sterile. That is partly why scientists and philosophers alike have always used imaginary scenarios to help sharpen their ideas and push them to their limits."" - _The Pig that Wants to be Eaten_, by Julian Baggini

For this meeting (June 4), we'll be discussing poverty and inequality and their relation to moral justification. We'll consider questions such as:

- ‚ÄãIs it more important to consider the number of people in poverty, or the proportion of people in poverty?

- ‚ÄãIf overall outcomes increase even as inequality worsens, is this progress?

- ‚ÄãDoes historical disenfranchisement morally require modern remediation?

- ‚ÄãWhen does/doesn't progress justify existing policies?


- ‚ÄãWe'll take some time to review this primer on is vs ought: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-6dt0G5wYu-DhlCrLrF41FTLvgw24tK-/view?usp=drive\_link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-6dt0G5wYu-DhlCrLrF41FTLvgw24tK-/view?usp=drive_link)

- ‚ÄãTo get a taste of what the discussion might be about, it is highly recommended to also read this short article beforehand: [https://people.brandeis.edu/~teuber/Pogge,%20World%20Poverty%20and%20Human%20Rights.pdf](https://people.brandeis.edu/~teuber/Pogge,%20World%20Poverty%20and%20Human%20Rights.pdf)


‚ÄãSome examples of things we've discussed at past meetings:

- ‚ÄãCould a vegetarian eat a pig with a clear conscience, if that pig wanted to be eaten?

- ‚ÄãDoes a person survive using a teleporter that destroys the body and recreates it with perfect fidelity?

- ‚ÄãDoes the existence of evil in the world pose a problem for belief in a benevolent God?


‚ÄãWe'll be meeting in the 550 Room (down the stairs on the North side). Contact me by text if you're having trouble finding the location.

‚ÄãOn the Wednesdays when we're not running this event, we'll often be having similar discussions here: [https://lu.ma/shortstories](https://lu.ma/shortstories)

About Event

# ‚Äã‚ôüÔ∏è This is one of the first & biggest SF Tech Chess Tournament **!**

‚Äã‚Äã **But this one is part of something MUCH, MUCH bigger.**

‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄãWe wanted to celebrate the launch of our **[Tech Games](https://techgames.beehiiv.com/subscribe)** **newsletter**‚Äîa curated calendar of the most electrifying tech gaming events across **London, SF, and NYC**.

That's when we decided to run an epic global series...

## ‚Äã **‚Äã** **[üèÖ The Founders‚Äô Olympics!](https://founders-olympics-2025.super.site/)** **üôåüèº**

‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã **12 curated tech gaming events. 3 cities** **_(SF, NYC, London)_** **in 3 weeks.** 1 goal: crown the sharpest minds in tech. üß†üß†

‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄãEach city will host:

- ‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚ô†Ô∏è Tech Poker

- ‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚ôüÔ∏è Tech Chess

- ‚Äã‚Äã‚Äãüé≤ Tech Catan

- ‚Äã‚Äã‚Äãüî´ Tech Paintball


‚ÄãEach event ends with a winner. Each city will crown 4 champions. **Will one of them be you? üèÜüòè**

_All levels welcome_ \- come it's gonna be fun! üòé

# ‚Äã **This is SF‚Äôs Tech Chess tournament ‚ôüÔ∏è‚ôüÔ∏è**

‚Äãüïí **Timing:**

Doors open **6:30pm sharp**

Doors close at **7:00pm** ‚Äî no late entries allowed

We‚Äôre serious about starting on time. Respect the board, respect the crew.

‚Äãüè° **Venue:**

Private **luxury 2,800 sqft condo in SoMa**

(you‚Äôll get the exact address upon approval)

‚Äãüëü **Note:**

This is a shoes-off space. Fresh socks encouraged.

We‚Äôll also be recording content ‚Äî come camera-ready üì∏

‚ÄãüéÆ **Format:**

Swiss-style tournament (10+0)

Top 2 players will face off in a 15+5 final

_(Don‚Äôt worry ‚Äî we‚Äôll explain everything before we start üòé)_

# ‚Äã **‚Äãüß† Who it‚Äôs for:**

- ‚Äã **Tech founders** who play to win

- ‚Äã **Operators** eyeing their next big move

- ‚Äã **Investors** who know games reveal more than coffee chats ever will


‚ÄãEvery seat is **vetted**.

‚úÖ Exceptional ability

‚úÖ Ambition you can feel

‚úÖ Obsession with building something real

‚Äã‚ùå No consultants

‚ùå No agencies

‚ùå No students

‚úÖ **All chess experience levels welcome!!**

* * *

# ‚ÄãüéØ **Why we love Chess:**

‚Äã‚ÄãOur thesis at [Founden.xyz](https://founden.xyz/) is that tech games attract the biggest tech brains ‚Äîthink **Demis Hassabis (chess)**, **Zuck (poker)**, and **Reid Hoffman (Catan)**.

‚ÄãChess is the perfect proxy for founder's strategic thinking and planning ‚Äî whether that's for deal-making, product strategy, and/or hiring. You need to evaluate a few moves in advances and pick the one that's the highest EV.

* * *

# ‚Äãüî• **Our goal with each of these events:**

‚Äã **We want our tech games to make you feel**

- ‚ÄãHyped & energized - _after hearing how much people around you have accomplished_

- ‚ÄãAppreciated & loved - _because we all go through the same emotional rollercoaster_

- ‚ÄãAccelerated as hell - _through relevant intros & killer insights_


* * *

# ‚Äãüéü **Don't miss out - save your spot!**

About Event

# ‚Äã‚ôüÔ∏è This is one of the first & biggest SF Tech Chess Tournament **!**

‚Äã‚Äã **But this one is part of something MUCH, MUCH bigger.**

‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄãWe wanted to celebrate the launch of our **[Tech Games](https://techgames.beehiiv.com/subscribe)** **newsletter**‚Äîa curated calendar of the most electrifying tech gaming events across **London, SF, and NYC**.

That's when we decided to run an epic global series...

## ‚Äã **‚Äã** **[üèÖ The Founders‚Äô Olympics!](https://founders-olympics-2025.super.site/)** **üôåüèº**

‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã **12 curated tech gaming events. 3 cities** **_(SF, NYC, London)_** **in 3 weeks.** 1 goal: crown the sharpest minds in tech. üß†üß†

‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄãEach city will host:

- ‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚ô†Ô∏è Tech Poker

- ‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚ôüÔ∏è Tech Chess

- ‚Äã‚Äã‚Äãüé≤ Tech Catan

- ‚Äã‚Äã‚Äãüî´ Tech Paintball


‚ÄãEach event ends with a winner. Each city will crown 4 champions. **Will one of them be you? üèÜüòè**

_All levels welcome_ \- come it's gonna be fun! üòé

# ‚Äã **This is SF‚Äôs Tech Chess tournament ‚ôüÔ∏è‚ôüÔ∏è**

‚Äãüïí **Timing:**

Doors open **6:30pm sharp**

Doors close at **7:00pm** ‚Äî no late entries allowed

We‚Äôre serious about starting on time. Respect the board, respect the crew.

‚Äãüè° **Venue:**

Private **luxury 2,800 sqft condo in SoMa**

(you‚Äôll get the exact address upon approval)

‚Äãüëü **Note:**

This is a shoes-off space. Fresh socks encouraged.

We‚Äôll also be recording content ‚Äî come camera-ready üì∏

‚ÄãüéÆ **Format:**

Swiss-style tournament (10+0)

Top 2 players will face off in a 15+5 final

_(Don‚Äôt worry ‚Äî we‚Äôll explain everything before we start üòé)_

# ‚Äã **‚Äãüß† Who it‚Äôs for:**

- ‚Äã **Tech founders** who play to win

- ‚Äã **Operators** eyeing their next big move

- ‚Äã **Investors** who know games reveal more than coffee chats ever will


‚ÄãEvery seat is **vetted**.

‚úÖ Exceptional ability

‚úÖ Ambition you can feel

‚úÖ Obsession with building something real

‚Äã‚ùå No consultants

‚ùå No agencies

‚ùå No students

‚úÖ **All chess experience levels welcome!!**

* * *

# ‚ÄãüéØ **Why we love Chess:**

‚Äã‚ÄãOur thesis at [Founden.xyz](https://founden.xyz/) is that tech games attract the biggest tech brains ‚Äîthink **Demis Hassabis (chess)**, **Zuck (poker)**, and **Reid Hoffman (Catan)**.

‚ÄãChess is the perfect proxy for founder's strategic thinking and planning ‚Äî whether that's for deal-making, product strategy, and/or hiring. You need to evaluate a few moves in advances and pick the one that's the highest EV.

* * *

# ‚Äãüî• **Our goal with each of these events:**

‚Äã **We want our tech games to make you feel**

- ‚ÄãHyped & energized - _after hearing how much people around you have accomplished_

- ‚ÄãAppreciated & loved - _because we all go through the same emotional rollercoaster_

- ‚ÄãAccelerated as hell - _through relevant intros & killer insights_


* * *

# ‚Äãüéü **Don't miss out - save your spot!**

‚ÄãWant in? Request your seat at the table.

About Event

## ‚Äã  Do you have what it takes to train with a US navy SEAL?

## ‚ÄãThe Day In The Life of a Navy SEAL Event is a transformational experience designed for men and women who want to shatter their limits and redefine what they're capable of.

‚Äã

Participants will set new thresholds for pain, resilience, discipline and inner strength.

We only use 50-60% of our potential. Sometimes we need to be reminded how far we can push ourselves. Join us to stretch and be reminded of your full potential.

![User Uploaded Image](https://images.lumacdn.com/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=cover,dpr=2,quality=75,width=800,height=285.09316770186336/editor-images/z9/f0a48bd3-c2dc-454a-9570-c94841bcf4c1.png)

## ‚ÄãWho is this for

- ‚ÄãIf you've built success but still feel stuck - mentally, physically or emotionally

- ‚ÄãIf you're craving the kind of challenge that pushes beyond your comfort zone

- ‚ÄãIf you want to break through personal barriers and build unshakeable resilience

- ‚ÄãIf you're ready to find out what you're truly capable of

- ‚ÄãIf you're seeking transformation through discomfort, attention to detail, and grit.


## ‚ÄãTrain with One of The Few :

‚ÄãOut of approximately 14,000 Navy SEALs in history, only a select few have the experience and leadership to guide others through transformation. [Alex Rogers](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alex-rogers1/) is one of them. A former Special Warfare Operator First Class (SO1), Alex served 12 years with SEAL Team 3 completing deployments to Iraq and The UAE.

‚Äã

## ‚ÄãThis isn't a Seminar. It's a Test.

‚ÄãThis experience is unlike any business event, sales training or networking event you've been to. It's about confronting discomfort, embracing discipline and discovering what you're truly capable of. You'll either breakthrough - or quit.

‚ÄãIf you make it through, you'll meet a version of yourself you've never seen before.

## ‚ÄãWhy We Created This

‚ÄãIn a world filled with meetups, events and seminars, we wanted to offer something different, something more immersive.

‚ÄãWhile therapy and psychedelics have their place, physical challenges remain one of the most direct paths to overcoming mental and emotional barriers. This event is designed to push you beyond your limits to help you build resilience from the inside out.

## ‚ÄãWhat To Expect

- ‚ÄãImmersive Training: Live the routines and disciplines of a Navy SEAL

- ‚ÄãLeadership Insights : Learn how Alex applies SEAL principles to business, family and fitness.

- ‚ÄãPhysical Challenge : Engage in activities that test your endurance and mental fortitude.

- ‚ÄãPersonal Feedback : Get direct feedback that you'll take to break through barriers and discover your true potential.


## ‚ÄãYour Mission

‚ÄãJoin us for this one-of-a-kind event. Learn from the best. Push yourself beyond what you thought possible. Transform your life.

‚ÄãNo minimum fitness level required. This is an individual test. Learn how US Navy SEALS train so they can be pushed to 20X what they thought was possible. Your max is inconceivable. You need to test yourself to find out what that is.

# ‚Äãüé≤ This is one of the first & biggest SF Tech Catan Tournament **!**

‚Äã‚Äã **But this one is part of something MUCH, MUCH bigger.**

‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄãWe wanted to celebrate the launch of our **[Tech Games](https://techgames.beehiiv.com/subscribe)** **newsletter**‚Äîa curated calendar of the most electrifying tech gaming events across **London, SF, and NYC**.

That's when we decided to run an epic global series...

## ‚Äã **‚Äã** **[üèÖ The Founders‚Äô Olympics!](https://founders-olympics-2025.super.site/)** **üôåüèº**

‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã **12 curated tech gaming events. 3 cities** **_(SF, NYC, London)_** **in 3 weeks.** 1 goal: crown the sharpest minds in tech. üß†üß†

‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄãEach city will host:

- ‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚ô†Ô∏è Tech Poker

- ‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚ôüÔ∏è Tech Chess

- ‚Äã‚Äã‚Äãüé≤ Tech Catan

- ‚Äã‚Äã‚Äãüî´ Tech Paintball


‚ÄãEach event ends with a winner. Each city will crown 4 champions. **Will one of them be you? üèÜüòè**

All levels welcome - come it's gonna be fun! üòé

# ‚Äã **This is SF‚Äôs Tech Catan tournament üêëüêë**

‚Äã **How this will work?**

‚ÄãBasically it's a Swiss-style tournament with 3 rounds. This means:

1. ‚ÄãYou're allocated to a table randomly

2. ‚ÄãAfter time is up, we'll stop - count points, shuffle tables, and play for another round.


‚Äã **_(We'll re-explain the rules before we start as a refresher üòé )_**

* * *

# ‚Äãüß† **Who it‚Äôs for:**

- ‚Äã **Tech founders** who play to win

- ‚Äã **Operators** eyeing their next big move

- ‚Äã **Investors** who know games reveal more than coffee chats ever will


‚ÄãEvery seat is **vetted**.

‚úÖ Exceptional ability

‚úÖ Ambition you can feel

‚úÖ Obsession with building something real

‚Äã‚ùå No consultants

‚ùå No agencies

‚ùå No students

‚úÖ **All Catan skill levels welcome!!**

* * *

# ‚ÄãüéØ **Why we love Catan:**

‚Äã‚ÄãOur thesis at [Founden.xyz](https://founden.xyz/) is that tech games attract the biggest tech brains ‚Äîthink **Demis Hassabis (chess)**, **Zuck (poker)**, and **Reid Hoffman (Catan)**.

‚ÄãCatan is the perfect proxy for founder energy‚Äîdeal-making, betrayal, trust-building, and long-game thinking. It‚Äôs how we get to know each other without the small talk.

* * *

# ‚Äãüî• **Our goal with each of these events:**

‚Äã **We want our tech games to make you feel**

- ‚ÄãHyped & energized - _after hearing how much people around you have accomplished_

- ‚ÄãAppreciated & loved - _because we all go through the same emotional rollercoaster_

- ‚ÄãAccelerated as hell - _through relevant intros & killer insights_


* * *

# ‚Äãüéü **Don't miss you - save your spot!**

‚ÄãWant in? Request your seat at the table.

# ‚Äãüé≤ This is one of the first & biggest SF Tech Catan Tournament **!**

‚Äã‚Äã **But this one is part of something MUCH, MUCH bigger.**

‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄãWe wanted to celebrate the launch of our **[Tech Games](https://techgames.beehiiv.com/subscribe)** **newsletter**‚Äîa curated calendar of the most electrifying tech gaming events across **London, SF, and NYC**.

That's when we decided to run an epic global series...

## ‚Äã **‚Äã** **[üèÖ The Founders‚Äô Olympics!](https://founders-olympics-2025.super.site/)** **üôåüèº**

‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã **12 curated tech gaming events. 3 cities** **_(SF, NYC, London)_** **in 3 weeks.** 1 goal: crown the sharpest minds in tech. üß†üß†

‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄãEach city will host:

- ‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚ô†Ô∏è Tech Poker

- ‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚ôüÔ∏è Tech Chess

- ‚Äã‚Äã‚Äãüé≤ Tech Catan

- ‚Äã‚Äã‚Äãüî´ Tech Paintball


‚ÄãEach event ends with a winner. Each city will crown 4 champions. **Will one of them be you? üèÜüòè**

All levels welcome - come it's gonna be fun! üòé

# ‚Äã **This is SF‚Äôs Tech Catan tournament üêëüêë**

‚Äã **How this will work?**

‚ÄãBasically it's a Swiss-style tournament with 3 rounds. This means:

1. ‚ÄãYou're allocated to a table randomly

2. ‚ÄãAfter time is up, we'll stop - count points, shuffle tables, and play for another round.


‚Äã **_(We'll re-explain the rules before we start as a refresher üòé )_**

* * *

# ‚Äãüß† **Who it‚Äôs for:**

- ‚Äã **Tech founders** who play to win

- ‚Äã **Operators** eyeing their next big move

- ‚Äã **Investors** who know games reveal more than coffee chats ever will


‚ÄãEvery seat is **vetted**.

‚úÖ Exceptional ability

‚úÖ Ambition you can feel

‚úÖ Obsession with building something real

‚Äã‚ùå No consultants

‚ùå No agencies

‚ùå No students

‚úÖ **All Catan skill levels welcome!!**

* * *

# ‚ÄãüéØ **Why we love Catan:**

‚Äã‚ÄãOur thesis at [Founden.xyz](https://founden.xyz/) is that tech games attract the biggest tech brains ‚Äîthink **Demis Hassabis (chess)**, **Zuck (poker)**, and **Reid Hoffman (Catan)**.

‚ÄãCatan is the perfect proxy for founder energy‚Äîdeal-making, betrayal, trust-building, and long-game thinking. It‚Äôs how we get to know each other without the small talk.

* * *

# ‚Äãüî• **Our goal with each of these events:**

‚Äã **We want our tech games to make you feel**

- ‚ÄãHyped & energized - _after hearing how much people around you have accomplished_

- ‚ÄãAppreciated & loved - _because we all go through the same emotional rollercoaster_

- ‚ÄãAccelerated as hell - _through relevant intros & killer insights_


* * *

# ‚Äãüéü **Don't miss you - save your spot!**

# ‚Äãüé≤ This is one of the first & biggest SF Tech Catan Tournament **!**

‚Äã‚Äã **But this one is part of something MUCH, MUCH bigger.**

‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄãWe wanted to celebrate the launch of our **[Tech Games](https://techgames.beehiiv.com/subscribe)** **newsletter**‚Äîa curated calendar of the most electrifying tech gaming events across **London, SF, and NYC**.

That's when we decided to run an epic global series...

## ‚Äã **‚Äã** **[üèÖ The Founders‚Äô Olympics!](https://founders-olympics-2025.super.site/)** **üôåüèº**

‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã **12 curated tech gaming events. 3 cities** **_(SF, NYC, London)_** **in 3 weeks.** 1 goal: crown the sharpest minds in tech. üß†üß†

‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄãEach city will host:

- ‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚ô†Ô∏è Tech Poker

- ‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚ôüÔ∏è Tech Chess

- ‚Äã‚Äã‚Äãüé≤ Tech Catan

- ‚Äã‚Äã‚Äãüî´ Tech Paintball


‚ÄãEach event ends with a winner. Each city will crown 4 champions. **Will one of them be you? üèÜüòè**

All levels welcome - come it's gonna be fun! üòé

# ‚Äã **This is SF‚Äôs Tech Catan tournament üêëüêë**

‚Äã **How this will work?**

‚ÄãBasically it's a Swiss-style tournament with 3 rounds. This means:

1. ‚ÄãYou're allocated to a table randomly

2. ‚ÄãAfter time is up, we'll stop - count points, shuffle tables, and play for another round.


‚Äã **_(We'll re-explain the rules before we start as a refresher üòé )_**

* * *

# ‚Äãüß† **Who it‚Äôs for:**

- ‚Äã **Tech founders** who play to win

- ‚Äã **Operators** eyeing their next big move

- ‚Äã **Investors** who know games reveal more than coffee chats ever will


‚ÄãEvery seat is **vetted**.

‚úÖ Exceptional ability

‚úÖ Ambition you can feel

‚úÖ Obsession with building something real

‚Äã‚ùå No consultants

‚ùå No agencies

‚ùå No students

‚úÖ **All Catan skill levels welcome!!**

* * *

# ‚ÄãüéØ **Why we love Catan:**

‚Äã‚ÄãOur thesis at [Founden.xyz](https://founden.xyz/) is that tech games attract the biggest tech brains ‚Äîthink **Demis Hassabis (chess)**, **Zuck (poker)**, and **Reid Hoffman (Catan)**.

‚ÄãCatan is the perfect proxy for founder energy‚Äîdeal-making, betrayal, trust-building, and long-game thinking. It‚Äôs how we get to know each other without the small talk.

* * *

# ‚Äãüî• **Our goal with each of these events:**

‚Äã **We want our tech games to make you feel**

- ‚ÄãHyped & energized - _after hearing how much people around you have accomplished_

- ‚ÄãAppreciated & loved - _because we all go through the same emotional rollercoaster_

- ‚ÄãAccelerated as hell - _through relevant intros & killer insights_


* * *

# ‚Äãüéü **Don't miss you - save your spot!**

# ‚Äãüé≤ This is one of the first & biggest SF Tech Catan Tournament **!**

‚Äã‚Äã **But this one is part of something MUCH, MUCH bigger.**

‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄãWe wanted to celebrate the launch of our **[Tech Games](https://techgames.beehiiv.com/subscribe)** **newsletter**‚Äîa curated calendar of the most electrifying tech gaming events across **London, SF, and NYC**.

That's when we decided to run an epic global series...

## ‚Äã **‚Äã** **[üèÖ The Founders‚Äô Olympics!](https://founders-olympics-2025.super.site/)** **üôåüèº**

‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã **12 curated tech gaming events. 3 cities** **_(SF, NYC, London)_** **in 3 weeks.** 1 goal: crown the sharpest minds in tech. üß†üß†

‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄãEach city will host:

- ‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚ô†Ô∏è Tech Poker

- ‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚ôüÔ∏è Tech Chess

- ‚Äã‚Äã‚Äãüé≤ Tech Catan

- ‚Äã‚Äã‚Äãüî´ Tech Paintball


‚ÄãEach event ends with a winner. Each city will crown 4 champions. **Will one of them be you? üèÜüòè**

All levels welcome - come it's gonna be fun! üòé

# ‚Äã **This is SF‚Äôs Tech Catan tournament üêëüêë**

‚Äã **How this will work?**

‚ÄãBasically it's a Swiss-style tournament with 3 rounds. This means:

1. ‚ÄãYou're allocated to a table randomly

2. ‚ÄãAfter time is up, we'll stop - count points, shuffle tables, and play for another round.


‚Äã **_(We'll re-explain the rules before we start as a refresher üòé )_**

* * *

# ‚Äãüß† **Who it‚Äôs for:**

- ‚Äã **Tech founders** who play to win

- ‚Äã **Operators** eyeing their next big move

- ‚Äã **Investors** who know games reveal more than coffee chats ever will


‚ÄãEvery seat is **vetted**.

‚úÖ Exceptional ability

‚úÖ Ambition you can feel

‚úÖ Obsession with building something real

‚Äã‚ùå No consultants

‚ùå No agencies

‚ùå No students

‚úÖ **All Catan skill levels welcome!!**

* * *

# ‚ÄãüéØ **Why we love Catan:**

‚Äã‚ÄãOur thesis at [Founden.xyz](https://founden.xyz/) is that tech games attract the biggest tech brains ‚Äîthink **Demis Hassabis (chess)**, **Zuck (poker)**, and **Reid Hoffman (Catan)**.

‚ÄãCatan is the perfect proxy for founder energy‚Äîdeal-making, betrayal, trust-building, and long-game thinking. It‚Äôs how we get to know each other without the small talk.

* * *

# ‚Äãüî• **Our goal with each of these events:**

‚Äã **We want our tech games to make you feel**

- ‚ÄãHyped & energized - _after hearing how much people around you have accomplished_

- ‚ÄãAppreciated & loved - _because we all go through the same emotional rollercoaster_

- ‚ÄãAccelerated as hell - _through relevant intros & killer insights_


* * *

# ‚Äãüéü **Don't miss you - save your spot!**

‚ÄãWant in? Request your seat at the table.

‚Äãüåç **What if the key to fighting climate change starts with stopping cows from burping methane?**

‚ÄãJoin us at The Wave as we host **Alex Brown**, cofounder and CEO of **Alga Biosciences**, a startup tackling a major contributor to climate change: methane emissions from cows. By preventing this potent greenhouse gas at the source, Alga is rethinking what climate solutions can look like.

‚ÄãIn this talk, we‚Äôll explore the bigger picture:

‚Äì What‚Äôs the right _order of operations_ for tackling the climate crisis?

‚Äì Can we _depoliticize_ climate change?

‚Äì What role should _capitalism_ play in solving it?

‚Äì And how do we balance _evolution_ vs. _revolution_ in industry?

‚ÄãThe answers may not be clear-cut, but this conversation will spark new ideas, challenge old assumptions, and leave us all with a little more hope about the future. üå±

About Event

‚Äã‚Äã **_‚≠êÔ∏è We're bringing Take2 to SF in collaboration with_** **_[Odd One In](https://www.instagram.com/playoddonein/)_** **_‚≠êÔ∏è_**

‚ÄãTake2 is for intentional and open minded daters. Instead of swiping, sending ""vibe check"" messages or feeling pressured to plan an incredible first date... come to Take2!

‚Äã‚ÄãHere's how it will work:

* * *

‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄãüìçThe Meet & Greet (June 8 @ 1-4 PM)

‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄãStart by filling out a quick values-based form. (This will help us for the 1 - 1 round on Tuesday)

‚ÄãJoin us for coffee and matcha on Sunday! ‚≠êÔ∏è

‚ÄãAll 40 singles will move around the room in groups with curated questions and activities.

‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄãAt the end of the event, you‚Äôll leave with a short list of your top 8 picks.

* * *

‚Äã‚Äã‚Äãüíå Curated 1-1 Speed dates (June 10 @ 6:30PM )

‚ÄãMeet the same group again on Tuesday night for a round of speed dates and a group mixer.

‚ÄãWe will put together 4 speed dates for 15 minutes each with your most compatible matches. Catch up over wine and tapas before enjoying your final group mixer.

‚ÄãSubmit your Top 5 picks from the end of the night.

* * *

‚Äã‚Äã‚Äãüì´ Check your inbox! (June 13)

‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄãBy June 13, you'll receive an email with your match and a method to exchange contact information - should you choose to follow up with a date.

* * *

‚Äã‚Äã‚Äãüí¨ Why Take2 is different:

- ‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã **Real matchmaking** ‚Äî no algorithms, no endless chats. Just thoughtful pairings from someone who‚Äôs paying attention.

- ‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã **Effortless** ‚Äî your first 2 meet cutes are all planned. Just show up!

- ‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã **Affordable** ‚Äî all the intention of high-end matchmaking, at a fraction of the price.

- ‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã **Safe & clear intentions** ‚Äî everyone at this event is single, genuinely interested, and open to being matched in the same way. You won‚Äôt have to wonder if someone‚Äôs serious, available, or just here for fun. The guessing game is over.


* * *

‚Äã‚Äã‚Äãüéü Your ticket includes access to both events + matchmaking. A beverage is included on date 1 and wine & tapas on date 2.

‚Äã‚Äã‚Äãüì∏ Heads up: We may take photos or videos during the event.

‚úÖ Please only sign up if you can attend _both_ June 8 and June 10.

‚Äã‚Äã‚Äãüî® While there isn't an explicit age restriction, our past events have typically served between the ages 23-31. We will monitor applicants to be within that age range!

‚Äã‚ÄãHere's how it will work:

* * *

‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄãüìçThe Meet & Greet (June 8 @ 1-4 PM)

‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄãStart by filling out a quick values-based form. (This will help us for the 1 - 1 round on Tuesday)

‚ÄãJoin us for coffee and matcha on Sunday! ‚≠êÔ∏è

‚ÄãAll 40 singles will move around the room in groups with curated questions and activities.

‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄãAt the end of the event, you‚Äôll leave with a short list of your top 8 picks.

* * *

‚Äã‚Äã‚Äãüíå Curated 1-1 Speed dates (June 10 @ 6:30PM )

‚ÄãMeet the same group again on Tuesday night for a round of speed dates and a group mixer.

‚ÄãWe will put together 4 speed dates for 15 minutes each with your most compatible matches. Catch up over wine and tapas before enjoying your final group mixer.

‚ÄãSubmit your Top 5 picks from the end of the night.

* * *

‚Äã‚Äã‚Äãüì´ Check your inbox! (June 13)

‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄãBy June 13, you'll receive an email with your match and a method to exchange contact information - should you choose to follow up with a date.

* * *

‚Äã‚Äã‚Äãüí¨ Why Take2 is different:

- ‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã **Real matchmaking** ‚Äî no algorithms, no endless chats. Just thoughtful pairings from someone who‚Äôs paying attention.

- ‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã **Effortless** ‚Äî your first 2 meet cutes are all planned. Just show up!

- ‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã **Affordable** ‚Äî all the intention of high-end matchmaking, at a fraction of the price.

- ‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã **Safe & clear intentions** ‚Äî everyone at this event is single, genuinely interested, and open to being matched in the same way. You won‚Äôt have to wonder if someone‚Äôs serious, available, or just here for fun. The guessing game is over.


* * *

‚Äã‚Äã‚Äãüéü Your ticket includes access to both events + matchmaking. A beverage is included on date 1 and wine & tapas on date 2.

‚Äã‚Äã‚Äãüì∏ Heads up: We may take photos or videos during the event.

‚úÖ Please only sign up if you can attend _both_ June 8 and June 10.

‚Äã‚Äã‚Äãüî® While there isn't an explicit age restriction, our past events have typically served between the ages 23-31. We will monitor applicants to be within that age range!

About Event

‚ÄãNote: while there are many guests listed in the RSVP, most of these are carried over from previous events in this series. We don't expect much more than 30 to attend.

I'm interested in having some laid-back yet stimulating conversations about some of my favorite pieces of short fiction.

‚ÄãA general aim of the stories will be to explore alternative possible worlds through fiction with the hope of gaining more insight into our own. To that end, many of the short stories will include an element of futurism, speculation, and social commentary. We‚Äôll feature authors like Ted Chiang, Ursula K Le Guin, Greg Egan, and others.

About Event

‚Äã _‚ÄúLadies and Gentlemen... and venture capitalists who pretend not to be competitive until someone mentions a buy-in..._‚Äù

‚ÄãImagine this...

> ‚ÄãOne minute, you‚Äôre debugging your app, the next, you‚Äôre invited to a royal poker tournament hosted by a man calling himself the **Spice King** ‚Äî who, let‚Äôs be clear, has never seen a seasoning he didn‚Äôt think he could turn into a personal brand.

* * *

## ‚Äãüì£ Hear Ye, Hear Ye ‚Äî All Are Welcome!

‚ÄãCalling all **tech titans**, **startup sorcerers**, **VC visionaries**, and now‚Ä¶ **card-curious rookies**!

‚ÄãYes, you there ‚Äî the one Googling ‚Äúwhat is a flop in poker and is it offensive?‚Äù ‚Äî **you‚Äôre invited too!**

‚ÄãThis isn‚Äôt just for people who learned poker from their crypto cult. This is for **everyone** ‚Äî from the **Poker Paprika Prodigies** to the **Cumin Newbies** who think Texas Hold'em is a BBQ event.

> ‚Äã **_We are expecting around 100 tournament participants._**

## ‚Äã _Estimated prize pool: $10,000_

* * *

## ‚Äãüì£ ROUGH AGENDA

‚Äã5:00 - 6:00pm \| socializing

6:00 - 10:30pm \| poker tournament

8:00 - 11:00pm \| DJ + music + more socializing

11:00 - 2:00am \| go to a bar together?

* * *

## ‚Äãüí∏ A $100 Buy-In For the Ride of Your Life

‚ÄãBring $100 and that beautiful blend of confidence and cluelessness ‚Äî because **winning isn't everything**...but telling people you once bluffed a venture capitalist _absolutely_ is.

‚ÄãThe tournament will be run similar to the last poker game I hosted ( [see the document here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13cRn2fHoQcpR_tp0-Po_Rr3_MvfxxpwQhTcroVYMlvA/))\*. We'll rotate seats throughout the tourney so you meet new people.

‚Äã‚ÄãCash games are table / house rules. If your table decides to play 3-5, you can play 3-5, etc. If you have problems or there is a disagreement, the table resolves it. Anything escalated will be resolved by myself or another host.

* * *

## ‚Äãü™Ñ Bust Out? Bust Back In!

‚ÄãShould you ‚Äúaccidentally donate‚Äù all your chips in a single hand (which we lovingly call **The Spicy Exit** ‚Ñ¢), fear not! We‚Äôve got **side games** with $100 to $300 buy-ins, for your redemption arc ‚Äî or further character development. And there is always socializing.

* * *

## ‚Äãüëë Royal Snacks, Regal Vibes

‚ÄãYour ticket includes snacks and drinks fit for a king ‚Äî because nothing says high-stakes drama like losing a hand while holding a mini quiche. üç∑

‚ÄãWhether you're there to **play**, **learn**, or **just eat your weight in hummus while nervously whispering ‚Äúhit me‚Äù to the wrong game**, this night‚Äôs for you.

* * *

## ‚Äãü´° TL;DR ‚Äì All Are Welcome!

‚Äã‚úÖ Experienced sharks & curious rookies

‚úÖ Socializers

‚úÖ Anyone who thinks ‚Äúflop‚Äù is just a bad startup pitch

* * *

‚Äã **RSVP now** and let‚Äôs raise the stakes together ‚Äî for fun, glory, and _maybe_ a venmo transfer of slightly spicy proportions.

‚ÄãWith card-slinging charisma and a cinnamon-scented crown,

**‚Äî The Spice King üå∂Ô∏è**

## ‚Äãüíº A Word from the Fine Print Department:

‚ÄãThe hosts aren‚Äôt pocketing anything from this event (unless you count empty snack wrappers and emotional damage).

‚ÄãThey‚Äôre doing it for the love of the game‚Ä¶ and because someone thought, _‚ÄúWhat if poker night, but spicy?‚Äù_

‚ÄãUnder the laws of California, this Tournament is legal.

\- There is no rake.

\- There is no paid staff dealing or working the tournament. Only food & drink.

\- Food / drink fees are distinctly separated from the Tournament entry fee.

\- This is not advertised to the public except members in the know.
