About Event ## ​ Do you have what it takes to train with a US navy SEAL? ## ​The Day In The Life of a Navy SEAL Event is a transformational experience designed for men and women who want to shatter their limits and redefine what they're capable of. ​ Participants will set new thresholds for pain, resilience, discipline and inner strength. We only use 50-60% of our potential. Sometimes we need to be reminded how far we can push ourselves. Join us to stretch and be reminded of your full potential. ## ​Who is this for - ​If you've built success but still feel stuck - mentally, physically or emotionally - ​If you're craving the kind of challenge that pushes beyond your comfort zone - ​If you want to break through personal barriers and build unshakeable resilience - ​If you're ready to find out what you're truly capable of - ​If you're seeking transformation through discomfort, attention to detail, and grit. ## ​Train with One of The Few : ​Out of approximately 14,000 Navy SEALs in history, only a select few have the experience and leadership to guide others through transformation. Alex Rogers is one of them. A former Special Warfare Operator First Class (SO1), Alex served 12 years with SEAL Team 3 completing deployments to Iraq and The UAE. ​ ## ​This isn't a Seminar. It's a Test. ​This experience is unlike any business event, sales training or networking event you've been to. It's about confronting discomfort, embracing discipline and discovering what you're truly capable of. You'll either breakthrough - or quit. ​If you make it through, you'll meet a version of yourself you've never seen before. ## ​Why We Created This ​In a world filled with meetups, events and seminars, we wanted to offer something different, something more immersive. ​While therapy and psychedelics have their place, physical challenges remain one of the most direct paths to overcoming mental and emotional barriers. This event is designed to push you beyond your limits to help you build resilience from the inside out. ## ​What To Expect - ​Immersive Training: Live the routines and disciplines of a Navy SEAL - ​Leadership Insights : Learn how Alex applies SEAL principles to business, family and fitness. - ​Physical Challenge : Engage in activities that test your endurance and mental fortitude. - ​Personal Feedback : Get direct feedback that you'll take to break through barriers and discover your true potential. ## ​Your Mission ​Join us for this one-of-a-kind event. Learn from the best. Push yourself beyond what you thought possible. Transform your life. ​No minimum fitness level required. This is an individual test. Learn how US Navy SEALS train so they can be pushed to 20X what they thought was possible. Your max is inconceivable. You need to test yourself to find out what that is. ## ​Meet Alex Rogers: Former Navy SEAL & Leadership Coach ​ Alex Rogers is a former U.S. Navy SEAL who served nearly 12 years, including deployments with SEAL Team THREE, one of the Navy’s most elite and storied special operations units.

Please choose your desired ticket type: Get Ticket You will be asked to verify token ownership with your wallet. About Event ​ _“Ladies and Gentlemen... and venture capitalists who pretend not to be competitive until someone mentions a buy-in..._” ​Imagine this... > ​One minute, you’re debugging your app, the next, you’re invited to a royal poker tournament hosted by a man calling himself the **Spice King** — who, let’s be clear, has never seen a seasoning he didn’t think he could turn into a personal brand. * * * ## ​ Hear Ye, Hear Ye — All Are Welcome! ​Calling all **tech titans**, **startup sorcerers**, **VC visionaries**, and now… **card-curious rookies**! ​Yes, you there — the one Googling “what is a flop in poker and is it offensive?” — **you’re invited too!** ​This isn’t just for people who learned poker from their crypto cult. This is for **everyone** — from the **Poker Paprika Prodigies** to the **Cumin Newbies** who think Texas Hold'em is a BBQ event. > ​ **_We are expecting around 100 tournament participants._** ## ​ _Estimated prize pool: $10,000_ * * * ## ​ ROUGH AGENDA ​5:00 - 6:00pm | socializing 6:00 - 10:30pm | poker tournament 8:00 - 11:00pm | DJ + music + more socializing 11:00 - 2:00am | go to a bar together? * * * ## ​ A $100 Buy-In For the Ride of Your Life ​Bring $100 and that beautiful blend of confidence and cluelessness — because **winning isn't everything**...but telling people you once bluffed a venture capitalist _absolutely_ is. ​The tournament will be run similar to the last poker game I hosted ( see the document here) *. We'll rotate seats throughout the tourney so you meet new people. ​​Cash games are table / house rules. If your table decides to play 3-5, you can play 3-5, etc. If you have problems or there is a disagreement, the table resolves it. Anything escalated will be resolved by myself or another host. * * * ## ​ Bust Out? Bust Back In! ​Should you “accidentally donate” all your chips in a single hand (which we lovingly call **The Spicy Exit** ™), fear not! We’ve got **side games** with $100 to $300 buy-ins, for your redemption arc — or further character development. And there is always socializing. * * * ## ​ Royal Snacks, Regal Vibes ​Your ticket includes snacks and drinks fit for a king — because nothing says high-stakes drama like losing a hand while holding a mini quiche.  ​Whether you're there to **play**, **learn**, or **just eat your weight in hummus while nervously whispering “hit me” to the wrong game**, this night’s for you. * * * ## ​ TL;DR – All Are Welcome! ​✅ Experienced sharks & curious rookies ✅ Socializers ✅ Anyone who thinks “flop” is just a bad startup pitch * * * ​ **RSVP now** and let’s raise the stakes together — for fun, glory, and _maybe_ a venmo transfer of slightly spicy proportions. ​With card-slinging charisma and a cinnamon-scented crown, **— The Spice King ️** ​ _https://instagram.com/spicekingofzanzibar_ * * * ​Check out other events I'm hosting at: ## ​ _https://lu.ma/spicekingofzanzibar_ * * * ## ​ A Word from the Fine Print Department: ​The hosts aren’t pocketing anything from this event (unless you count empty snack wrappers and emotional damage). ​They’re doing it for the love of the game… and because someone thought, _“What if poker night, but spicy?”_ ​Under the laws of California, this Tournament is legal. - There is no rake. - There is no paid staff dealing or working the tournament. Only food & drink. - Food / drink fees are distinctly separated from the Tournament entry fee. - This is not advertised to the public except members in the know. ​ _ *Document for example only.
