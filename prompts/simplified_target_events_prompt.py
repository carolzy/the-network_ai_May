2. Extract key_differentiators from the company's unique value propositions found in the analysis
3. Use the target_recommendations directly for the target_customers array (all of them)
4. Create who_to_target based on the primary_industries and target_audience data
5. Generate event_strategies that are specific to this company's industry focus and customer base
6. Recommend specific_events that would be most relevant for this particular business
